# Google-Analytics-4-Project-Segment-Overlap-Audience-Comparison


## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Google Analytics 4 Custom Segment Overlap Report.** and the main aim of this project is to Comparison of Users lying into two main Segments : Purchasing vs Non Purchasing Users. I analyzed how much engagement rate  and number of active users these two Users segments brought over  particular timeframe. With this report I was able to examine  various segments and find out users who overlap  into other segments to generate insights which can help to individual  targeting. 

**Disclaimer:** This project uses demo data; no real business data is involved.

## ✅ Recommended Actions
- To be able to get a clear difference between gap of Purchasers segment and Purchasers only segment is by clearly defining the segments. Sometimes in a Segment an User will view the product eventually the User will fall in both segments regardless buying or not , hence the difference. 
- We can analyze by User lifetime report about the behavior of Non Purchasing Users to highlight key points and optimize actions accordingly. 
- We can also get an overview or difference between drop off paths or events between Purchasers and Non Purchasers getting a clear idea regarding why Non Purchasers fail to become Purchasers by creating a Funnel exploration or Path exploration report.
